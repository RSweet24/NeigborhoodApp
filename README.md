You can either download the zip file containing all of the files or clone the repository at https://github.com/RSweet24/NeigborhoodApp.git.

Once downloaded, Open the Index.html file in the Web Browser. You will see a Google Maps focused on Silicon Valley and some locations in that area including the Google Corporate Office.

Feel free to click on each one there will be a picture associated with each location that has a marker and some information about the location. There is a list of all the locations on the right side of the screen which is collapseable, It will also automatically collapse once the screen reaches a certain size. 

I chose Silicon Valley because i am a huge Google fan and supporter so please enjoy the application.
